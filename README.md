# Lets Play the Dice Game!

##### *Disclaimer: The game itself and the rules are not my own idea.*

#### Tools/methods used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OOP, fully Responsive.

#### This game was developed as a portable version for my family members who like to play the dice game as well as to practice my developer skills in JavaScript. Rules for the game can be found in the rules tab within the game.

#### Have fun!
